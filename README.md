#  Simon Game
A classic memory game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** .Players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds. Each round adds a new color to the sequence â€” how long can you keep up?

* Event listeners and user input handling
* Animations with jQuery
* Game logic and state management
* Sound integration with the Web Audio API

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
* HTML5

* JavaScript (ES6)
* jQuery (for simple animations and effects)


ðŸŽ¯ How to Play
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the color pattern that appears.
3. Repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in the same order.
4. Each level adds one more color to the sequence.
